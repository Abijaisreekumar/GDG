This project introduces an eco-friendly solution to energy waste by capturing kinetic energy from human footsteps in high-traffic environments. By combining piezoelectric technology with a modern IoT infrastructure, the system not only generates power but also provides a transparent, real-time data logging system for energy monitoring.
